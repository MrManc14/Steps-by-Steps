                by half. With the 2.9 trillion tons of food we waste each year, we could feed all 800 million undernourished people
                in the world twice. Besides wasting valuable land, fuel, and water resources, food waste contributes to global
                warming through the fossil fuel-heavy process of growing, harvesting, and shipping food. Currently, the average
                American family wastes up to two thousand two hundred dollarsâ€™ worth of food per year. Letâ€™s do our best to reduce
                that number- the next time you go shopping, plan ahead, and only buy what you need. Share plates at restaurants. Eat
                leftovers as much as possible. One person making a commitment to produce zero food waste keeps 300 pounds of food
                from being thrown out over the course of a year. So, imagine what would happen if everyone made these changes."

                forget to see the resources and energy that went into manufacturing and shipping that product. For instance, because
                cotton plants require so much water, a single cotton T-shirt can require up to 713 gallons of water- enough to keep
                one person well-hydrated for over five years. Consider thrifting some of your clothes to save both money and resources. "
